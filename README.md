Project completed during the application process for the 2020 Indiana Pacers Performance Analytics Intern position. 

The goal of the project was to analyze the occurrences of concussions in the NBA over the last ten seasons and to attempt to determine their effect on shooting statistics as well as the likelihood of the player suffering a lower-body soft tissue injury.
